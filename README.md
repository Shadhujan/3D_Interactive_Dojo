# 3D Interactive Dojo – Web Experience Template

## Overview

This project is a **3D interactive web experience** built with **React, TypeScript, Three.js, and React Three Fiber**. It was originally planned as an **interactive personal portfolio**, where users could explore a virtual space and interact with elements to discover content.

At the current stage, this project works as a **template for immersive 3D web applications**. It focuses on movement, camera control, lighting, and scene structure. In the future, it will be expanded with real interactions, portfolio content, and optimized assets.

## Features

* First-person movement (WASD controls)
* Mouse-look using pointer lock
* Modular 3D scene structure (interior & exterior)
* Dynamic lighting and environment
* UI overlay built with React and Tailwind CSS
* Deployed as a web-based 3D experience

---

## Tech Stack

* **React + TypeScript**
* **Three.js**
* **@react-three/fiber**
* **@react-three/drei**
* **Vite**
* **Tailwind CSS**

---

## Controls

* **W / A / S / D** – Move
* **Mouse** – Look around
* **Click** – Lock pointer / interact (future use)

---

## Project Status

This project is currently a **base template**. Some planned features (interaction system, audio, jump physics, optimized textures) are not fully implemented yet.

Future updates will focus on:

* Interactive objects
* Portfolio sections inside the 3D space
* Asset optimization and performance improvements
* Better collision and physics handling

## Notes

This project is part of a learning and experimentation process with 3D on the web. Code structure is designed to be readable and extendable rather than production-optimized.

### GLB Viewer

I created a dedicated utility to inspect, validate, and debug GLB models before integrating them into this 3D environment. This tool helps in checking model statistics, hierarchy, and scaling.
